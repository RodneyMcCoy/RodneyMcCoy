<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>

<p> I am a First Year Math Ph.D. student at the University of Utah. I'm not sure what I want to do research in yet, but my main interests are Algorithms, Applied Analysis, and Number Theory. </p>

<h3 align="left">Teaching</h3>


<p>In August I will be a funded Teaching Assistant at the University of Utah.</p>



<h3 align="left">Research</h3>


<p>I am currently working on undergraduate research with Dr. Alex Woo relating to measures of disorder on the symmetric group, an inequality derived from them, and an extension of a condition for when equality holds to the group of signed permutations. You can view the project I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/RodneyMcCoy/shallow-permutations">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can visit my GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/RodneyMcCoy">here</a> to see code, projects, and references to other work i've done.</li>
</li>
  <li>When I have free time (normally only during breaks), I work on problems from Project Euler. You can see my progress <a href = "https://projecteuler.net/progress=RodneyMcCoy">here</a>.</li>
