<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>
<p> I am a First Year Math Ph.D. student at the University of Utah. My main interests are Algorithms, Applied Analysis, and Number Theory. </p>

<h3 align="left">Teaching</h3>
<ul>
  <li> I am currently a funded Teaching Assistant at the University of Utah. I will (tentativly) be assisting with Differential Equations and Linear Algebra (Math 2250) this semester. </li>
</ul>

<h3 align="left">Research</h3>
<p>I am currently working on undergraduate research with Dr. Alex Woo relating to measures of disorder on the symmetric group, an inequality derived from them, and an extension of a condition for when equality holds to the group of signed permutations. You can view the project I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/RodneyMcCoy/shallow-permutations">here</a>.</p>

<h3 align="left">Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When I have free time (normally only during breaks), I work on problems from Project Euler.</li>
</ul>
