<ul>
  <li> Summer 2024, I will be actively doing Research under the NSF - sponsered Research Training Grant "RTG: Optimization and Inversion for the 21st Century Workforce".
  <li> In 2022 - 2023, I was doing undergraduate research with Dr. Alex Woo relating to measures of disorder on the symmetric group, an inequality derived from them, and an extension of a condition for when equality holds to the group of signed permutations.
