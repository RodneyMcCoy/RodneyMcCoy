<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>

<p> I will be a math Ph.D. student at the University of Utah starting in August. </p>


<h3 align="left">Research</h3>


<p>I am currently working on undergraduate research with Dr. Alex Woo relating to measures of disorder on the symmetric group, an inequality derived from them, and an extension of a condition for when equality holds to the group of signed permutations. You can view the project I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/RodneyMcCoy/shallow-permutations">here</a>.</p>


<h3 align="left">Tutoring</h3>
